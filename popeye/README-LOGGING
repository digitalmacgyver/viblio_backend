Logging
-------

The logging level is specified in the popeye*.config file(s) as

loglevel: `LVL`

where LVL is one of: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL.  YOU NEED
THE BACK-TICKS!!!

Within your application, a simple print() statement is treated as level
DEBUG, and will only appear in the log(s) if the LVL is set to DEBUG.

When you want to fine tune your log output, within the application
endpoint code:

  web.ctx.log.debug( 'This is a DEBUG message' )
  web.ctx.log.info( 'This is an INFO message' )
  web.ctx.log.warning( 'This is a WARNING message' )
  web.ctx.log.error( 'This is an ERROR message' )
  web.ctx.log.critcal( 'This is a CRITCAL message' )

If LVL is set to WARNING for example, only warning(), error() and
critical() messages will appear in the log file(s).

print( 'This is debug' ) is the same as web.ctx.log.debug( 'This is debug' )

When run under Apache in production mode, the application output is captured
in the apache log file, and looks like this:

[Thu Aug 01 18:38:27 2013] [error] popeye: Thu, 01 Aug 2013 18:38:27 INFO This is info!
[Thu Aug 01 18:38:27 2013] [error] popeye: Thu, 01 Aug 2013 18:38:27 DEBUG This is debug!

So you may grep for 'popeye' and get your output.
