5. Resolve DEBUGs throughout the code.
6. Add logging throughout the code.

7. Think about how to manage counting / reporting.

8. Alter FaceRecognize to use this.

9. Alter Facebook import to populate this.

== Counting / reporting ==

What if recognize face creates a row:

id
user_id
face_url
feedback_recieved = bool
recognized = bool
matched_face_id
face1_id
face1_confidence
face2_id
face2_confidence
face3_id
face3_confidence

recognize_feedback( recognize_id, { 1,2,3 or None } )

We need a recogize_stats( user_id=None )

count( * ) == attempted matches
count where result == None == False positives
